Our research article on teleportation on a quantum network got published in [**Nature**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04697-y), and covered by [**The New York Times**](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/25/technology/quantum-internet-teleportation.html) (ü§Ø)

Using our three-node quantum network, which we developed and demonstrated in an [earlier publication](/publication/2021_realization_multinode_quantum_network_remote_solid_state_qubits/), we teleported quantum information between two nodes that are not directly connected with each other. 

Here is an explanation video from QuTech on the topic:

If you are interested in more of a light reading, here's a [blog post by Sophie](https://blog.qutech.nl/2021/02/25/ready-set-measure/) about running a similar experiment (the three-node network from last year), giving you a peek into what it is like to run one of these!
