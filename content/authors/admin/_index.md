I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in Hannes Bernien's group at the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering, University of Chicago. 
We are developing quantum network nodes using neutral atoms and nanophotonic cavities.
Previously, I obtained my PhD in the group of Prof. Ronald Hanson, realising the world's first entanglement based quantum network.
