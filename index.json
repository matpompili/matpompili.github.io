Moreover, the abstraction of tasks and services offered by the quantum network should enable platform-independent applications to be executed without knowledge of the underlying physical implementation. Here we experimentally demonstrate, using remote solid-state quantum network nodes, a link layer and a physical layer protocol for entanglement-based quantum networks. The link layer abstracts the physical-layer entanglement attempts into a robust, platform-independent entanglement delivery service. The system is used to run full state tomography of the delivered entangled states, as well as preparation of a remote qubit state on a server by its client. Our results mark a clear transition from physics experiments to quantum communication systems, which will enable the development and testing of components of future quantum networks.","tags":[],"title":"Experimental demonstration of entanglement delivery using a quantum network stack","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"caniusethat is a wrapper around PyZMQ that enables easy RPC (remote procedure call) functionality.\nGet started caniusethat can be installed via pip:\npip install caniusethat ","date":1661990400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661990400,"objectID":"6324d64075207992cc9b8419544824c2","permalink":"https://matpompili.github.io/project/caniusethat/","publishdate":"2022-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/caniusethat/","section":"project","summary":"A wrapper around PyZMQ that enables easy RPC (remote procedure call) functionality.","tags":null,"title":"üëÄ caniusethat","type":"project"},{"authors":["Sophie L.

In the single-photon, protocol entanglement is heralded by generation of qubit-photon entangled states and subsequent detection of a single photon behind a beam splitter. In this work we perform a detailed theoretical and experimental investigation of this protocol and its various sources of infidelity. We develop an extensive theoretical model and subsequently tailor it to our experimental setting, based on nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. Experimentally, we verify the model by generating remote states for varying phase and amplitudes of the initial qubit superposition states and varying optical phase difference of the photons arriving at the beam splitter. We show that a static frequency offset between the optical transitions of the qubits leads to an entangled state phase that depends on the photon detection time. We find that the implementation of a Charge-Resonance check on the nitrogen-vacancy center yields transform-limited linewidths. Moreover, we measure the probability of double optical excitation, a significant source of infidelity, as a function of the power of the excitation pulse. Finally, we find that imperfect optical excitation can lead to a detection-arm-dependent entangled state fidelity and rate. The conclusion presented here are not specific to the nitrogen-vacancy centers used to carry out the experiments, and are therefore readily applicable to other qubit platforms.","tags":[],"title":"Entangling remote qubits using the single-photon protocol: an in-depth theoretical and experimental study","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"easypubsub is a simple wrapper around PyZMQ that provides an easy interface to the PubSub (Publish-Subscribe) functionality of ZeroMQ.\nIn PubSub, a publisher publishes a message to a topic and a subscriber subscribes to that topic and receives the message.

Quantum teleportation allows for the reliable transfer of quantum information between distant nodes, even in the presence of highly lossy network connections. Although many experimental demonstrations have been performed on different quantum network platforms, moving beyond directly connected nodes has, so far, been hindered by the demanding requirements on the pre-shared remote entanglement, joint qubit readout and coherence times. Here we realize quantum teleportation between remote, non-neighbouring nodes in a quantum network. The network uses three optically connected nodes based on solid-state spin qubits. The teleporter is prepared by establishing remote entanglement on the two links, followed by entanglement swapping on the middle node and storage in a memory qubit. We demonstrate that, once successful preparation of the teleporter is heralded, arbitrary qubit states can be teleported with fidelity above the classical bound, even with unit efficiency. These results are enabled by key innovations in the qubit readout procedure, active memory qubit protection during entanglement generation and tailored heralding that reduces remote entanglement infidelities. Our work demonstrates a prime building block for future quantum networks and opens the door to exploring teleportation-based multi-node protocols and applications.","tags":[],"title":"Qubit teleportation between non-neighbouring nodes in a quantum network","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matteo Pompili"],"categories":null,"content":"Our research article on teleportation on a quantum network got published in Nature, and covered by The New York Times (ü§Ø)\nUsing our three-node quantum network, which we developed and demonstrated in an earlier publication, we teleported quantum information between two nodes that are not directly connected with each other.\nHere is an explanation video from QuTech on the topic: Media coverage QuTech press release Nature News and Views The New York Times ANSA, Italian.

It has enabled applications far beyond what it was originally built for, and it will continue to exceed our expectations for the future. Quantum computers, and the network that will connect them‚Äîthe Quantum Internet‚Äî are likely going to follow the same path. Differently from normal computers, quantum computers can share a property called entanglement, which allows the qubits (quantum bits) to be connected at a much more fundamental level. This property enables a range of new applications that span secure communication to enhanced metrology. Over the past fifteen years, significant progress has been made in connecting rudimentary quantum network nodes via long-distance entanglement. Several quantum platforms have demonstrated entanglement generation between two physically separated qubits. In this thesis we take a significant step forward, both in terms of experimental complexity achieved, and in the abstraction of said complexity for future developments. Moving past two-node experiments required a fundamental redesign of our experimental apparatus, as well as developing the capabilities to control simultaneously the additional node. The first result of this thesis is building a three-node entanglement-based quantum network. We demonstrated distribution of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states over the network, as well as a building block for larger networks: entanglement swapping. Differently from previous multi-node demonstrations, which relied on post-selection, our network is able to perform the entanglement distribution in a heralded fashion: a signal will notify the users that the protocol was successful, and that the state is ready to be used. The second result builds on the first, by adding control over a fifth qubit, improving the quality of the entanglement, and introducing a novel repetitive readout technique, to achieve quantum teleportation of a qubit from the third node to the first‚Äînodes that do not share a direct entanglement channel. The third and final result is the demonstration of entanglement delivery using a quantum network stack. The Internet is built using a plethora of physical platforms: optical fibers, Ethernet cables, Wi-Fi, satellite signals etc. To abstract their functionality, and make applications work regardless of the underlying platform, a layered approach was developed in the 1970s (the Internet protocol). Taking inspiration from classical network stacks, we demonstrate the first two layers of a quantum network stack, the physical layer (where the qubits, lasers and signal generators live), and the link layer, which abstracts the concepts of qubit and entanglement generation such that they can be used by applications at the higher-layers, hiding the complexity of the quantum platform being used.","tags":[],"title":"Multi-Node Quantum Networks with Diamond Qubits","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matteo Pompili","Sophie L.
